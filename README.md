## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The raw dataset contained multiple issues and inconsistencies. Key cleaning steps included:

  - Standardized formats and converted to numeric types.

- **Title Column Enhancements:**
  - Extracted meaningful information to create:
    - `General Role`
    - `Skills`

- **Experience Level:**
  - Derived `Experience Level` column based on cleaned experience years.

- **Location Mapping:**
  - Created a `Country` column by mapping from `City of Company Site`.

- **Text Fixes:**
  - Fixed typos, whitespace issues, and inconsistent formatting.

> ✅ Cleaned data saved as `salary(cleaned).csv`  
> ✅ Cleaning script in `data_cleaning.py`
